# Expo App (Prebuild Setup)

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev/) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) and initialized using the prebuild workflow (`npx expo prebuild`) for easier native customization.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install

2. Run on Android

npx expo run:android

3. Run on iOS

npx expo run:ios

Requires macOS and Xcode.

Development Tools

You can open the app in:

A development build

The Android emulator

The iOS simulator

Expo Go (for projects that do not require native code changes)



---

Project Structure

Start developing by editing the files inside the app directory.

This project uses file-based routing.


---

Reset to Blank App

To reset to a blank template:

npm run reset-project

This command moves the starter code to the app-example directory and gives you a fresh app directory.
